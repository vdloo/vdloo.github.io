    <h1>The SICP reading project</h1>
    <p class="muted">02 July 2014</p>

    <p>Programming all day is fun, but the reality is that I am in college
studying something non-technical. I just wrapped up my third year of
pursuing a BBA in International Media and Entertainment Management,
a degree that focuses mainly on topics such as marketing, social research,
and as the name suggests: management. While those fields are interesting
in their own right, it is not the thought of <i>The Lean Startup</i>
methodology or Alan Bryman's <i>Social Research Methods</i> that have me
behind a keyboard late at night drinking coffee. Tinkering with computers
is something special, there truly is nothing like it. Writing code gives
you the chance to create systems only limited in their complexity and
potency by your own capabilities and imagination.</p>

<p>Because the curriculum of my formal studies rarely ventures into the
technical side of things I have to resort to refining my programming
skills in my free time. Writing code during school nights and in the
weekends is great but doing so during a break is great on a whole other
level. The prospect of being able to sit down and hack away at the ideas
in my head without disturbance is what has me counting down the days on
the calendar for these rare long stints of uninterrupted time. Reaching
that state of total immersion and focus is just a bit easier if the
deadline for the next paper isn't in the back of your head.</p>

<p>For the past two years I have tried to use a large part of my summer break
to sit down and teach myself something of value. In the summer of 2012
I spent many nights poring over <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html">Beej's Guide to Network Programming</a>
and taking apart the source of various packet forging tools in order to
cook up a way to send data over wifi without associations, a project
that in retrospect turned out to be an impractical solution for the
problem that I was trying to solve but nonetheless served as a valuable
learning experience. Last year I used the summer break to brush up on my
PHP. I took a five month back-end web development internship after the
summer and I felt the need to prepare myself because I wasn't really
sure what to expect when transitioning from a hobbyist writing code to
doing so in a professional environment for the first time.</p>

<p>Even though I ended up doing fine during my internship, there were moments
where I struggled because of being a self-taught programmer. Those moments
could often be attributed to situations where I had simply never before
seen the problem at hand. There were also situations where I had
encountered the problem before but in my non-traditional studies had only
seen a specific implementation of the solution, failing to comprehend the
abstract concept behind it.</p>

<p>When I think about autodidactism I remember reading Richard Feynman's
biography <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">Surely You're Joking, Mr.
Feynman!</a></i> where he mentions
"having peculiar methods for doing integrals" because of being
self-taught using the book <i>Advanced Calculus</i> by Frederick S Woods.
Feynman argues that he had an advantage over his peers because he had
a different "box of tools". He explains that the advantage
manifested itself because only after his peers would have exhausted their
own more standard "toolkit" they would come to him with their
problem. If he was able to solve it with his less conventional methods he
would then be regarded in a positive manner. During my internship
I noticed this pattern as well, but unfortunately the dynamic works both
ways. There were times where I felt at an advantage because of possessing
some skills that might not generally be taught at a formal education, like
jumping around in the command-line and configuring servers. A unix
environment had always been my IDE so these things were native to me, but
when it came to things like design principles and programming paradigms
I felt at a loss. There was this layer of common understanding that the
people with a background in formal education seemed to be having,
a foundation of shared knowledge that made them able to communicate ideas
to each other on a basis of relating the problem presented to a set of
core principles that transcended implementation. A shared foundation that
I was never forced to pick up on in my self studies.</p>

<p>Differentiating between programmers that are self-taught and those that
have had a more traditional education is difficult because in reality all
programmers are self-educated. The only way to really learn is by
tinkering, and that is something that in the end you have to do on your
own. Learning software development is an iterative process where you
bounce back and forth between doing and soaking up information. Being
self-taught and being formally educated are not mutually exclusive in
programming, this is what makes it possible for people to be formally
educated and have unconventional methods but also possible to be
self-taught and have conventional methods. It is perfectly possible for
someone to sit at home all day studying on coursera or reading through
college textbooks to learn the same things as someone who is attending
a computer science course at a university. Conversely it is also possible
for someone who is a computer science major to pick up on unconventional
skills because he chooses to start working on his assignments without
reading the course literature, we can all understand the urge to start
building the proverbial IKEA closet without reading the manual. What
I observed for the real difference to be among programmers is the
distinction between having learned using a structured set of information,
and by means of the concept of "bricolage".</p>

<p>The word "bricolage" comes from the French "bricoleur",
which means "handyman". Bricolage literally translates into the
infinitive phrase "to tinker". Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss
used it in his 1962 book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Savage_Mind">The Savage
Mind</a></i> to draw an analogy about
mythical thought and how it "can reach brilliant unforeseen results on
the intellectual plane" even though "the characteristic feature of
mythical thought is that it expresses itself by means of a heterogeneous
repertoire which, even if extensive, is nevertheless limited". This
quote describes that mythical thought tries to solve new problems with the
use of an existing collection of resources. Lévi-Strauss continues with
his analogy where he states that:</p>

<p><quote> The "bricoleur" is adept at performing a large number
of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he does not subordinate each
of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and
procured for the purpose of the project. His universe of instruments is
closed and the rules of his game are always to make do with "whatever
is at hand" </quote></p>

<p>The analogy of bricolage fits writing code really well, it is at the very
core of hacker culture to celebrate the creative misuse of whatever tools
and systems that are available. It is exactly this spirit that drives
people to pursue incredible feats such as for example <a href="https://github.com/shinh/sedlisp">implementing a LISP
in sed</a>. It says a lot about the culture
around programming that the collective instantly recognizes the ingenuity
of such projects and have it upvoted to the top of Hacker News and
/r/programming. The problem however with bricolage in a context where any
task can be completed with any tool is that it becomes unnecessary to look
for alternative and more appropriate solutions when encountering a new
problem. If any task can be completed by "working with what you
have" you are never forced to expand beyond your comfort zone. Here
lies the danger of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">Law of the instrument</a>.</p>

<p>The general process for my learning has generally been a. form an idea of
what needs to be done, b. find a way to do it, c. do it. This works very
well for doing rapid development and picking up a wide range of knowledge
along the way, however this bottom up approach forces you only to learn
the bare essentials for everything you want to do, making it more
difficult to form a big picture in the long run. Step b. "find a way
to do it" is where the bricolage manifests itself. The way this works
is that you start searching for the things you know (the available
materials). You google for keywords that in your mind are related to the
goal you are trying to achieve and when you find the solution you remember
where to find it for the next time. This cycle repeats itself until you
have a network of knowledge that enables you to solve many problems, but
it won't necessarily be the best solutions. You keep adding knowledge
to your toolbox based on the limited set of knowledge you already had,
essentially bubbling yourself. You can not google for what you do not
know.</p>

<p>Only looking for what you need when you need it introduces many blind
spots (unknown unknowns). I believe that in order to minimize the effect
the things that you don't know have on your work you can do two
things: 1. get exposed to ideas novel to you and 2. move as far away from
implementation and as close to concepts as possible by focusing on
abstraction. The first one is like watching cable television instead of
Netflix, how would you ever know you like watching manatees on National
Geographic if all you do is queue the next Person of Interest episode? The
second one is about learning "why" instead of "how". Both
those solutions point to a formal education in computer science because
a university will guide you by telling you what to study. Seeing as I am
already in the process of getting a different degree I'm going to have
to settle for something else.</p>

<p>I like books. Fiction, non-fiction, everything. They are a good use of
trees and bytes and they often present information on a topic from start
to finish in a nice structured fashion, something that the web often does
not offer. Whenever you scour the internet for recommendations for
programming books the top results are often K&amp;R and SICP. While finishing
K&amp;R is still on my bucket list, SICP seems a more appropriately fit for
current learning goals.</p>

<p>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs authored by Hal Abelson,
Jerry Sussman and Julie Sussman is a well known computer science textbook
that used to be taught as an introductory course at MIT. It is a book
often praised for its focussed attention on abstraction and being one of
the first book to teach "programming" instead of teaching
a "programming language". Many have argued that even though the
book was originally published in 1985, there still hasn't been
anything written that teaches the concepts from the book better than the
book itself. The book uses mit-scheme (a LISP dialect) to explain it's
concepts. LISP is a family of programming languages that has been around
since 1958 and is still relevant to the current industry, especially since
functional programming languages are on the rise again. You can't bat
an eye before come across someone's blog about that next new cool
thing in Haskell or Clojure.</p>

<p>So as an attempt to break out of the cycle of predominantly learning only
what I need to know in order to make things work, I have started working
through the SICP exercises. So why specifically this book instead of any
other book on computer science? I could argue that articles such as <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html">the
one from Brian Harvey</a> or
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8">Peter Norvig</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G05B1TQ5XGZP">Paul
Graham's</a> reviews on Amazon
convinced me, but the reason why I haven't give up yet is because of the
available community support. I have worked through
a couple of exercises already and because of the large amount of blogs
available from people who have already done the exercises, there is
a unique opportunity to look into the thought process others had solving
the same problems, which is really nice.</p>
