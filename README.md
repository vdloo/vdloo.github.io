Personal blog
=============

Source code of my static [website](http://rickvandeloo.com). 

It's a real basic setup (jekyll + bootstrap) but it fits my needs for simple blogging.

To generate the static site install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), pygments and rdiscount on your system 

```
# apt-get install jekyll python-pygments
# gem install rdiscount
```

Then simply run:

```
$ jekyll build
```
